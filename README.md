# This is my porfolio project that will be deployed using Github Pages

It consists of (at this point) 3 pages: About Me, Target App, and Saurian App. I consider these two projects my most interesting, so they will remain center stage while other projects will be placed in a drop down menu. 

## Target Better Price App

This application will take in 3 variables from the user, and use them to dteremine where the user can find their product the cheapest/closest. The purpose of this application is to help the user save money when wanting to buy big ticket items from Target and wanting to save some money at the same time. Eventually, the application will have the ability to take in multiple products, and find stores with all/most products within the given distance.

This application will leverage 2 APIs: a Target API meant to search for locations/products, and a Tax-rate API to determine the effective tax rate at each location.

## Saurian Translator

This application will take an input from the user, and then translate it to/from the fictional language Saurian. The application has the ability to partially identify proper nouns, and will eventually have the ability to let the user identify proper nouns. 

The Saurian language comes from a video game called Star Fox Adventures. A language created to be spoken by the inhabitants of an all-dinosaur planet simply called Dinosaur Planet. The language itself is a simple cipher language.
